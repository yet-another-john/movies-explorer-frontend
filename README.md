The final project is done. 

This is a service where you can search for movies on demand and save them in your personal account. 

Here's what was done: 

    • set up infrastructure and created Express server;
    
    • connected database, created API schemas and resource models;
    
    • implemented logging, authentication and authorization on the server;
    
    • components made up in React, markup was ported to the React format;
    
    • described the logic and layout of registration, login, profile editing, and saved movies pages;
    
    • asynchronous GET- and POST-requests to the API were implemented;
    
    • authorized and unauthorized states, saving movies in the profile were worked out;
    
    • received movies are filtered on the client side.
